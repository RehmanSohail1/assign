    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
         It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears;
          and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions
           are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming
            groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females,
             and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large
              ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge
               when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do
                not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

<p>The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant
     of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,
     [6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] Dogs were the first
      species to be domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before the
       development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have
        expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive
         on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]</p>

<p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus
     Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a
      white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and 
      wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring 
      large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of
       its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become
        independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>
