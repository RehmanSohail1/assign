   <p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[1] in the
     family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[1] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred
      species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants
       that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with
        sharp prickles.[2] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy,
         in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to
          Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa
          .[2] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often 
          are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants
           range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters
            in height.[2] Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the
             development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>
